<span style="font-size: 2rem;">:fontawesome-solid-quote-left: Hi, I'm Stefan! Welcome to my vlog.</span>

My unique angle is that I’ll be exploring the intersection of [_Generative AI_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) and [_Game Development_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development), using my PhD training to break down the latest research and make it make sense. I’ll be documenting everything and open-sourcing my code and notes so you can follow along.

Some background on myself, I have a PhD in [_Machine Learning_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) from [_Oxford_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford), so I can digest and think critically about the latest research. I can code pretty well too. Although, I’m a total noob to [_Unity_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)>), [_C#_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>), [_Blender_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)>), and game dev concepts in general (linear blend skinning? particle systems? pixel shaders? what even is this???)

We’re going to learn a lot together&mdash;so let’s crack on with it!
